            <h2> About me </h2>
            <p> Hello and welcome! 👋 I'm Vikashini — an aspiring developer with a love for creativity, tech, and detective stories!  
                By day, I am learning to build apps with HTML, and by night, you will probably find me sketching or solving mysteries like a true detective. 🕵️‍♀️  
                I am passionate about creating beautiful, useful things — from simple calculators to fun craft apps.  
                My goal? To grow into a confident, skilled software developer and earn a place in top companies like Google, Amazon, Zoho, or Facebook.  
                Every project I build is a small step toward that big dream. 💫 </p>
